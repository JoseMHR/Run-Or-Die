The aim of these projects uploaded to github, are only instructional, 
wants to acquire EXPERIENCE, learn, and also show the code publicly to others people 
in case some piece of code helps you because they want to do something similar.

Some of them are made from scratch (as AnimalSounds), others may contain modified pieces 
of some tutorial or other github projects (like destroyAll).
